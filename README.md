##Protein Contacts with U-Net++ Architecture

This repository contains the details regarding my master thesis project on optimsation of contact map predictions using U-net++ architecture. 

This is based on the work by the Elofsson Group at SciLife Lab where contact map predictions were made using the Unet architecture. This paper can be found at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/08/02/383133.full.pdf

U-Net architecture is used for biomedical image segmentation. This is based on the work of https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/

For my project, I am making use of the U-Net++ architecture (can be found at https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00889-5_1) and enhacing PconsC4 protein contact predictions.
